# UFO-s

## Overview

This assignment aimed to build a web page that contained data on UFO sightings throughout the country. The data included the date of the sighting, the state, the country, shape, duration, and description of the encounter. The task was to build an option to filter the original table to match the specified search criteria.

## Results

Navigating the site can be done by inputting one or multiple search queries into the input fields.

## Summary

When the page is first visited, I believe the table can look overwhelming at first. All the data is presented at once, which could confuse someone visiting the site for the first time.

The following images will demonstrate the results of navigating from the first screen to one filter and finally adding a second filter.

I believe it would be beneficial to add a range function to the filters. I think seeing the number of sightings in a specific period would be a good thing. It would make it easier for people who use the webpage to try and map out UFO patterns. A user could put in a shape and a specified range of time to see if any patterns emerge.

The last recommendation is an option to add pictures if they are available. I believe the easiest way to do this would be to add another column to the table. There would probably be some empty rows in the column, but the entries that have a picture to accompany would add another good element to the webpage.
